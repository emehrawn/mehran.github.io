'''A Vehicle is not a real-world object. Rather, it is a concept that some real-world objects 
(like cars, trucks, and motorcycles) embody. 
We would like to use the fact that each of these objects can be considered a vehicle to remove repeated code.
We can do that by creating a Vehicle class:'''




class Vehicle(object):
    """A vehicle for sale by Jeffco Car Dealership.

    Attributes:
        wheels: An integer representing the number of wheels the vehicle has.
        miles: The integral number of miles driven on the vehicle.
        make: The make of the vehicle as a string.
        model: The model of the vehicle as a string.
        year: The integral year the vehicle was built.
        sold_on: The date the vehicle was sold.
    """

    base_sale_price = 0

    def __init__(self, wheels, miles, make, model, year, sold_on):
        """Return a new Vehicle object."""
        self.wheels = wheels
        self.miles = miles
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.sold_on = sold_on


    def sale_price(self):
        """Return the sale price for this vehicle as a float amount."""
        if self.sold_on is not None:
            return 0.0  # Already sold
        return 5000.0 * self.wheels

    def purchase_price(self):
        """Return the price for which we would pay to purchase the vehicle."""
